# Intelligent CI/CD Pipeline Optimization

## Objective
The project leverages machine learning to optimize CI/CD pipeline performance, focusing on reducing build and test times while improving overall efficiency. By analyzing historical CI/CD logs and using predictive models, it identifies bottlenecks and provides actionable insights for optimization.

## Key Features
1. **Bottleneck Prediction**  
   - Analyze historical CI/CD logs to identify and predict pipeline bottlenecks.  
2. **Optimization Suggestions**  
   - Provide recommendations to enhance build and test efficiency, such as resource allocation and parallelization.  
3. **Test Case Prioritization**  
   - Rank test cases based on historical failure rates and criticality to streamline testing processes.  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Machine Learning Framework:** Scikit-learn  
- **CI/CD Tools:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions  
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus  

This project combines the power of data analytics and machine learning to transform CI/CD pipelines into smarter, faster, and more efficient systems.
